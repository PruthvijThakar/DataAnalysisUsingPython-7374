Then digital cameras and cellphones turned photos into something more ephemeral and more easily shared. But as the case of Anthony Weiner demonstrated, photos that are shared but are not meant to last, sometimes stick around. Mr. Weiner's downfall does not seem to have discouraged people from sharing risqu\u00e9 photos. According to a study by the Pew Research Center's Internet and American Life Project that is due out later this year, 6 percent of adult Americans admit to having sent a ''sexually suggestive nude or nearly nude photo or video'' using a cellphone. Another 15 percent have received such material. Three percent of teenagers admit to sending sexually explicit content.","abstract":"Nick Bilton Disruptions column on Snapchat, an app that helps people share their private and perhaps risque photos in a more cautious fashion; notes app allows a person to take and send a picture and control how long it is visible by the person who receives it, up to 10 seconds.
