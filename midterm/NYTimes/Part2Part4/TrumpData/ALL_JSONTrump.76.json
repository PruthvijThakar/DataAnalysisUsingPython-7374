In retrospect, looking around their elegant but startling living room, they admit they hadn't really known exactly what the result would be. Mr. Minars took his clients at their word, and rather than shopping in showrooms for predictable pieces, he decided to buy art furniture. The resulting apartment summarizes one of the latest and strongest trends in New York design, 1986: the chairs, tables, desks, cabinets and lights are all designed by artists as one-of-a-kind, signed pieces, with strident colors, odd shapes and angular profiles. Despite their individuality, they add up to a coherent look and a strong statement.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"APARTMENT OF THE MOMENT: THE LATEST IN TRENDS"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"MINARS, ALLEN"},{"name":"glocations","value":"NEW YORK CITY"},{"name":"glocations","value":"TRUMP TOWER"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERIOR DECORATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"APARTMENT HOUSES"}],"pub_date":"1986-01-02T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Home Desk","section_name":"Home and Garden; Style","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Joseph","rank":1,"lastname":"GIOVANNINI"}],"original":"By JOSEPH GIOVANNINI"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd149948eb7c8105d6266cd","word_count":1164,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/02\/23\/us\/trump-talk-rattles-aerospace-industry-up-and-down-supply-chain.html","snippet":"Many in the field fear border tariffs and trade deals will raise the cost of American airplanes, sending shock waves though its thousands of suppliers....","lead_paragraph":"Many in the field fear border tariffs and trade deals will raise the cost of American airplanes, sending shock waves though its thousands of suppliers.","abstract":null,"print_page":12,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"width":75,"url":"images\/2017\/02\/24\/us\/24AEROSPACE-02\/23AEROSPACE-01-thumbStandard.jpg","rank":0,"height":75,"subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2017\/02\/24\/us\/24AEROSPACE-02\/23AEROSPACE-01-thumbStandard.jpg","thumbnailwidth":75},"type":"image"},{"width":600,"url":"images\/2017\/02\/24\/us\/24AEROSPACE-02\/23AEROSPACE-01-articleLarge.jpg","rank":0,"height":400,"subtype":"xlarge","legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"xlarge":"images\/2017\/02\/24\/us\/24AEROSPACE-02\/23AEROSPACE-01-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":400},"type":"image"},{"width":190,"url":"images\/2017\/02\/24\/us\/24AEROSPACE-02\/23AEROSPACE-01-thumbWide.jpg","rank":0,"height":126,"subtype":"wide","legacy":{"wide":"images\/2017\/02\/24\/us\/24AEROSPACE-02\/23AEROSPACE-01-thumbWide.jpg","widewidth":190,"wideheight":126},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Trump Talk Rattles Aerospace Industry, Up and Down Supply Chain","print_headline":"Tough Talk on Trade  Rattles Aerospace Firms, Both Large and Small"},"keywords":[{"isMajor":"N","rank":1,"name":"subject","value":"Airlines and Airplanes"},{"isMajor":"N","rank":2,"name":"subject","value":"International Trade and World Market"},{"isMajor":"N","rank":3,"name":"organizations","value":"Boeing Company"},{"isMajor":"N","rank":4,"name":"glocations","value":"Pacific Northwestern States (US)"},{"isMajor":"N","rank":5,"name":"subject","value":"Customs (Tariff)"},{"isMajor":"N","rank":6,"name":"persons","value":"Trump, Donald J"},{"isMajor":"N","rank":7,"name":"subject","value":"United States Politics and Government"}],"pub_date":"2017-02-23T15:14:54+0000","document_type":"article","news_desk":"National","section_name":"U.S.","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Kirk","lastname":"JOHNSON"}],"original":"By KIRK JOHNSON"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"58aefc737c459f2525d1e17e","word_count":1164,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/1986\/02\/08\/business\/high-rents-but-high-sales-too.html","snippet":"The Atrium in Trump Tower includes some of the most expensive retail space on Fifth Avenue, and the expensive stores that lease the space report some of the highest sales per square foot in the United States.
