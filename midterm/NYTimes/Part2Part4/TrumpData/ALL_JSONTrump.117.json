I am even more amazed that no one in Trump's army of publicists and other assorted henchmen managed to kill the piece. Surely, someone in the Trump camp realized how bizarre he sounded -- like some combination of medieval king and Mafia don, doling out rewards and punishment to his subjects. Although it is heartwarming to know that Trump had no trouble getting dinner reservations even during \"the tough times,\" isn't there a more appropriate venue for his exercise in narcissism? Like the offices of a good psychiatrist?

Donald John Trump exhibited a flair for self-promotion, grandiose schemes - and, perhaps not surprisingly, for provoking fury along the way. Senior realty titans scoffed, believing that braggadocio was the sum and substance of the blond, blue-eyed, six-footer who wore maroon suits and matching loafers, frequented Elaine's and Regine's in the company of fashion models, and was not abashed to take his armed bodyguard-chauffeur into a meeting with an investment banker. The essence of entrepreneurial capitalism, real estate is a business with a tradition of high-rolling megalomania, of master builders striving to erect monuments to their visions. It is also typically dynastic, with businesses being transmitted from fathers to sons and grandsons, and carried on by siblings. In New York, the names of Tishman, Lefrak, Rudin, Fisher, Zeckendorf come to mind.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"THE
