It was striking, as the House voted 221 to 209 to send the rebels $100 million for their effort to overthrow the Nicaraguan Government, how many of those voting in favor nonetheless expressed deep misgivings about the worthiness of the rebels, also known as contras, and their ability to accomplish their goal. Had this been some abstract debate on Central American policy, the outcome in the Democratic-controlled House might well have been different. But there was nothing abstract about it. In effect, the issue before the House was whether Ronald Reagan should receive a mandate to conduct foreign policy as he sees fit. The lesson of the pro-Reagan vote was that, when the issue is close, the President - perhaps any President, but certainly this one when he puts his prestige on the line - is likely to prevail.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"REAGAN AND THE CONTRAS WIN A ROUND IN THE HOUSE","kicker":"TRUMP CARDS"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"REAGAN, RONALD WILSON"},{"name":"glocations","value":"NICARAGUA"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES"},{"name":"subject","value":"INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"},{"name":"subject","value":"CIVIL WAR AND GUERRILLA WARFARE"},{"name":"subject","value":"FOREIGN AID"},{"name":"subject","value":"UNITED STATES ARMAMENT AND DEFENSE"}],"pub_date":"1986-06-29T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Week in Review Desk","section_name":"Washington; Week in Review","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","firstname":"Linda","rank":1,"lastname":"GREENHOUSE"}],"original":"By LINDA GREENHOUSE"},"type_of_material":"News","_id":"4fd170148eb7c8105d662d7c","word_count":919,"slideshow_credits":null},{"web_url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/02\/18\/world\/middleeast\/trump-dubai-vancouver.html","snippet":"Two new developments highlight the complications created when the president of the United States owns a sprawling real estate company....","lead_paragraph":"Two new developments highlight the complications created when the president of the United States owns a sprawling real estate company.","abstract":null,"print_page":12,"blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"width":75,"url":"images\/2017\/02\/19\/world\/19dubaitrump2\/19dubaitrump2-thumbStandard.jpg","rank":0,"height":75,"subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2017\/02\/19\/world\/19dubaitrump2\/19dubaitrump2-thumbStandard.jpg","thumbnailwidth":75},"type":"image"},{"width":600,"url":"images\/2017\/02\/19\/world\/19dubaitrump2\/19dubaitrump2-articleLarge.jpg","rank":0,"height":400,"subtype":"xlarge","legacy":{"xlargewidth":600,"xlarge":"images\/2017\/02\/19\/world\/19dubaitrump2\/19dubaitrump2-articleLarge.jpg","xlargeheight":400},"type":"image"},{"width":190,"url":"images\/2017\/02\/19\/world\/19dubaitrump2\/19dubaitrump2-thumbWide.jpg","rank":0,"height":126,"subtype":"wide","legacy":{"wide":"images\/2017\/02\/19\/world\/19dubaitrump2\/19dubaitrump2-thumbWide.jpg","widewidth":190,"wideheight":126},"type":"image"}],"headline":{"main":"Trump\u2019s Dual Roles Collide With Openings in Dubai and Vancouver","print_headline":"With Glitzy Openings in Dubai and Vancouver, Trump\u2019s Roles Collide"},"keywords":[{"isMajor":"N","rank":1,"name":"glocations","value":"Vancouver (British Columbia)"},{"isMajor":"N","rank":2,"name":"glocations","value":"Dubai (United Arab Emirates)"},{"isMajor":"N","rank":3,"name":"organizations","value":"Trump Organization"},{"isMajor":"N","rank":4,"name":"persons","value":"Trump, Donald J"},{"isMajor":"N","rank":5,"name":"persons","value":"Sajwani, Hussain"},{"isMajor":"N","rank":6,"name":"subject","value":"United States Politics and Government"},{"isMajor":"N","rank":7,"name":"organizations","value":"Trump International Golf Club, Dubai"},{"isMajor":"N","rank":8,"name":"organizations","value":"Trump International Hotel & Tower Vancouver"},{"isMajor":"N","rank":9,"name":"subject","value":"Conflicts of Interest"}],"pub_date":"2017-02-18T18:09:02+0000","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Foreign","section_name":"World","subsection_name":"Middle East","byline":{"person":[{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":1,"firstname":"Ben","lastname":"HUBBARD"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":2,"firstname":"Eric","lastname":"LIPTON"},{"organization":"","role":"reported","rank":3,"firstname":"Dan","lastname":"LEVIN"},{"firstname":"Richard","middlename":"C.","lastname":"PADDOCK","rank":4,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By BEN HUBBARD, ERIC LIPTON, DAN LEVIN and RICHARD C.

Tears rolling down their cheeks, they couldn't stop laughing or keep their contagion of chuckles from spreading to almost half the other girls at their boarding school. Some fits were lasting minutes, others hours, some up to 16 days, until exasperated administrators closed the school five months later. Afflicted girls were sent home to their villages around Lake Victoria, where they duly infected more children and young adults with their ''sickness.'' Before the epidemic finally relented, in 1964, it forced the temporary closing of more than 14 schools, all because of unstoppable laughter. What was so funny no one ever discovered, but the mirth gathered a momentum that caught hundreds of unsuspecting villagers in its riptide. At the time, it was considered a pathology to be quarantined and quashed. But today, this unmoored laughter is celebrated in over 1,000 laughter clubs worldwide as a therapy to reduce stress, lower blood pressure, strengthen the immune system and perhaps even lead to world peace.","abstract":"Laughter clubs are springing up worldwide as a therapy to reduce stress, lower blood pressure, strengthen immune system and confer other benefits; photo (MP","print_page":"7","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[],"headline":{"main":"Got the Giggles?
