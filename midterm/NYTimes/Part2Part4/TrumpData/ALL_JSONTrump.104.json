But sometimes his riches are hard to find. This article was adapted from ''TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald,'' by Timothy L. O'Brien, a reporter for The New York Times. The book, to be published on Wednesday by Warner Books, looks inside Mr. Trump's wallet. BY 1993, with his casinos in hock, most of his real estate holdings either forfeited or stagnant and his father slipping into the fog of Alzheimer's disease, Donald Trump, at the age of 47, had run out of money. There were no funds left to keep him aloft, and as the bare-bones operation he maintained in Manhattan started to grind to a halt, he ordered Nick Ribis, the Trump Organization's president, to call his siblings and ask for a handout from their trusts. Donald needed about $10 million for his living and office expenses, but he had no collateral to provide his brother and sisters, all three of whom wanted a guarantee that he would repay them.","abstract":null,"print_page":"1","blog":[],"source":"The New York Times","multimedia":[{"url":"images\/2005\/10\/23\/business\/23trump.75.jpg","subtype":"thumbnail","legacy":{"hasthumbnail":"Y","thumbnailheight":75,"thumbnail":"images\/2005\/10\/23\/business\/23trump.75.jpg"},"type":"image","height":75}],"headline":{"main":"What's He Really Worth?"},"keywords":[{"name":"persons","value":"TRUMP, DONALD J"},{"name":"organizations","value":"TRUMP ORGANIZATION"},{"name":"subject","value":"GAMBLING"},{"name":"subject","value":"FINANCES"}],"pub_date":"2005-10-23T00:00:00Z","document_type":"article","news_desk":"Money and Business\/Financial Desk","section_name":"Business","subsection_name":null,"byline":{"person":[{"firstname":"Timothy","middlename":"L.","lastname":"O'BRIEN","rank":1,"role":"reported","organization":""}],"original":"By TIMOTHY L.
