Gliedman, the former City Housing Commissioner, had been in his new job less than three weeks when his new employer, Donald J. Trump, called him into his office on the morning of May 22. Mr. Trump had just read in the newspaper that the Koch administration had decided to start all over in its six-year effort to rebuild the Wollman Memorial Rink in Central Park. The city was proposing to hire an engineering company to draw up plans for a new rink, and if all went well, New Yorkers might be ice skating again in 18 months. ''Donald said he felt that we could do this in four months,'' Mr. Gliedman recalled last week.
