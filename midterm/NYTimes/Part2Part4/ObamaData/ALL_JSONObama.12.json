But then, few people emerge from their college years to become president of the United States. So President Obama couldn't have been too surprised to see the new issue of that magazine carrying an excerpt from the journalist David Maraniss's forthcoming biography, ''Barack Obama: The Story,'' which featured a letter that Mr. Obama wrote to his college girlfriend in the 1980s, discussing the worldview of T. S. Eliot's poetry and prose. ''Read his essay on Tradition and the Individual Talent, as well as Four Quartets ...'' wrote Mr. Obama, then in his early 20s. ''Remember how I said there's a certain kind of conservatism which I respect more than bourgeois liberalism -- Eliot is of this type. Of course, the dichotomy he maintains is reactionary, but it's due to a deep fatalism, not ignorance.''","abstract":"Op-Ed article by Adam Kirsch, senior editor at The New Republic, reflects on an early letter written by undergraduate Barack Obama about the poet T S Eliot, which is included in an excerpt from the David Maraniss book Barack Obama: The Story.
