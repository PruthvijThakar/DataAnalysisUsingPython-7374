Flight Data

 * Click <a href="Data">here</a> to view the data downloaded.
 * Files are segregated based on location of airport, shortforms of Airlines' name and Flights data.
 * Files are stored in csv format.
 * Files are scalaed down because the original files were more than 650 mbs in size so just a sneak is given
